# Dog Breed Image Classification via Convolutional Neural Networks

## Introduction

53% of Americans households include a dog, creating a huge market and need for canine care products. A strong dog image classification model can have many applications including creating more custom/personalized product recommendations to pet parents. Dog classification would also allow for more personalized marketing of these products. 

Additionally, a dog image classification model could be a tool to help identify lost dogs and help reunite them with their owners through facial recognition.

Barking Data Inc. would like to develop this model in order to sell the various applications that will come out of it to pet product companies, veterinary offices, animal rescues and other companies who may benefits from these tools.

To begin the development of the model we will eventually sell, we will start by building a model using the 50 most popular dog breeds. Additionally, we will generate our own dataset using Selenium to scrape Google Images.

## Data Sources

Notebooks 1 and 2 concentrate on scraping Google Images for images of the top 50 dog breeds to develop our own dataset. 

In later notebooks, we combine our original dataset with the Stanford Dog dataset. This can be downloaded [here](https://render.githubusercontent.com/http://vision.stanford.edu/aditya86/ImageNetDogs/). Be sure to rename the downloaded folder to "stanford-dog-Images". For simplicity, we also narrowed the Stanford dataset to dog breeds only included in our original list of top 50 dog breeds. Because some of the dog breeds did not exist in the Stanford dataset, we remain with 37 breeds. We're including this list below for quicker reproduction. Please only keep these folders (and re-name them accordingly) in the "stanford-dog-Images" dataset. Finally, add this folder to the repo.

## Results

### Baseline Model

<img align="center" src="Results-Images/Baseline Model.png" width="400" height="600">

We began our modelling process using a densely connected network as our baseline model. This model performed poorly, with an accuracy around 3% across both the testing and training sets as well as demonstrating significant overfitting. 

### CNN Modelling & Transfer Learning

Following poor performance from a densely connected network, we moved on to CNN networks. We didn't see much improvement in these models until trying a gridsearch. The gridsearch model resulted in a roughly 29% accuracy on train data and a roughly 19% accuracy on test data. However, overfitting still remained a problem. 

Transfer learning via VGG19 and Inceptionv3 also did not yield much improvemnt.

### Step by Step CNN Following Dataset Combination

Following out lack of success with our existing dataset, we combined our dataset with the Stanford dog dataset to increase our sample size. From here, we built a CNN model using a step-by-step process. We specifically tried to address overfitting via dropout regularization and weight decay. While our weight decay model yielded the highest accuracy (86%), overfitting only improved slightly. Our dropout regularization model is our final model, with an accuracy of 55% for our training data and 53% for our test data. Loss was roughly 1.8 for both groups.   

## Conclusions & Next Steps

The best model generated is Model 4 from our last notebook - the original dropout regularization model. The accuracy of this model was 55% for our training data and 53% for our test data. Loss was roughly 1.8 for both groups. 

While some of our other models demonstrated greater accuracy, like Model 5 which had an 86% accuracy, all of our models demonstrated more overfitting.

* Increase the size of our dataset. We saw strong improvements after combining our data with the Stanford Dog dataset.
* Test leveraging K-fold cross validation to improve our model. This may help prevent some of the overfitting we're seeing.
* Once we have an improved model, we should try to expand our model to provide predictions for mixed-breed dogs.
